## 🚀 How to Use

### Adding New Videos

1. Go to `lib/data/mock_data.dart`
2. Add new entries to the `videosData` or `shortsData` lists
3. The UI will automatically update

### Customizing Colors

1. Open `lib/core/app_colors.dart`
2. Modify the color constants
3. Changes will apply app-wide

### Adding New Screens

- **Subscriptions Screen**: Placeholder for subscribed channels
- **Profile Screen**: User profile and settings placeholder
- **Bottom Navigation**: Easy switching between main sections

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Add Real Data**: Replace mock data with API calls
2. **Add State Management**: Implement Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod
3. **Add Navigation**: Implement detailed video viewing
4. **Add Interactions**: Implement like, comment, share functionality
5. **Add Authentication**: User login and profile management

## 💡 Tips for Beginners

1. **Start Small**: Understand one folder at a time
2. **Follow the Pattern**: Use the existing structure when adding new features
3. **Read Comments**: Each file has explanatory comments
4. **Experiment**: Try modifying colors, text, or adding new mock data
5. **Ask Questions**: The structure is designed to be self-explanatory

This clean architecture makes it easy to understand how Flutter apps are structured and provides a solid foundation for building more complex features.
